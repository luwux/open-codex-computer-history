# Open Codex Computer History

A clean-room, open implementation of the event-stream architecture behind
Computer History in the ChatGPT/Codex desktop app.

It records macOS interaction events through Accessibility and Core Graphics. It
does not take screenshots, record video, or capture audio.

## Status

Version `0.2.0` is a working clean-room reference implementation:

- Native Swift recorder for app/window changes, clicks, drags, text-input bursts,
  submits, shortcuts, terminal changes, and selections.
- Recovered nested `EventStreamRecord` schema with app, window, mouse, keyboard,
  selection, AX tree, and diagnostic payloads.
- Rotating JSONL segments compatible with the observable Computer History
  layout: `events.jsonl` and `metadata.json`, with suppressed activity counted
  but not persisted.
- App/domain include and exclude policies, private-browsing filtering, secure
  text-field filtering, and 48-hour event retention.
- Original-name MCP tools for pause, resume, status, get settings, and replace
  settings, plus search, summarization, and deletion tools.
- UTC-aligned 10-minute and 6-hour summary pipeline with persistent bucket
  deduplication, single-instance locking, and a failure circuit breaker.
- Ephemeral `codex exec` summarizer that writes local Markdown memories.
- Read-only IPC inspector for the installed proprietary service.
- Native-compatible open IPC server, a timeline MCP View, a SwiftUI menu-bar
  app, and opt-in LaunchAgent packaging.
- A signed synthetic Fixture App, deterministic AX/CGEvent driver, and
  structural JSONL comparator for the final original-vs-open recording audit.

## Package and install

Build the ad-hoc signed menu-bar application:

```bash
npm run app:package
```

The result is:

```text
dist/Open Computer History.app
```

Opt in to local launch services for the menu, native IPC, summary pipeline, and
MCP endpoint:

```bash
npm run install:local
```

This writes user LaunchAgents and is not run automatically. The installed MCP
endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:3317/mcp`.

Remove services while preserving history data:

```bash
npm run uninstall:local
```

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or newer
- Swift 5.10 or newer
- Node.js 22.22 or newer
- Codex CLI, only for AI-generated summaries

## Build

```bash
npm install
npm run collector:build
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

For a release collector:

```bash
swift build --package-path collector -c release
```

## Permissions

The recorder requires Accessibility and Input Monitoring. It does not require
Screen Recording.

```bash
collector/.build/debug/open-history permissions
```

Enable the built `open-history` binary in:

- System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
- System Settings > Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring

Verify:

```bash
collector/.build/debug/open-history status
```

## Record

Normal text capture matches the official default:

```bash
npm run collector:record
```

Record for a bounded smoke test:

```bash
collector/.build/debug/open-history record --duration 30
```

To opt out of ordinary text persistence, set `"captureText": false` in
`config.json`. Secure fields and private browsing are always suppressed.

The CLI can explicitly force text capture:

```bash
collector/.build/debug/open-history record --capture-text
```

Password fields, excluded apps/domains, and private-browsing windows are always
suppressed and their event bodies are not persisted.

Data is stored under:

```text
~/.open-codex-computer-history/
  config.json
  segments/<timestamp>-<id>/
    events.jsonl
    metadata.json
  memories/resources/*.md
```

Override the root with `OPEN_COMPUTER_HISTORY_HOME`.

## Configure

Copy [config.example.json](config.example.json) to:

```text
~/.open-codex-computer-history/config.json
```

Policies support either excluding listed sources or including only listed
sources.

## MCP

Start the local MCP server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The endpoint is `http://localhost:3000/mcp`. Available tools:

- `computer_history_pause`
- `computer_history_resume`
- `computer_history_status`
- `computer_history_get_settings`
- `computer_history_update_settings`
- `computer-history-status`
- `get-recent-computer-history`
- `search-computer-history`
- `summarize-computer-history`
- `clear-computer-history`
- `show-computer-history`
- `delete-computer-history-item` (app-private)

Example terminal validation:

```bash
npx mcp-use client connect history http://localhost:3000/mcp
npx mcp-use client history tools list
npx mcp-use client history tools call computer-history-status
npx mcp-use client history tools call get-recent-computer-history \
  '{"hours":1,"limit":20,"includeText":false}'
```

## Summaries

`summarize-computer-history` starts a temporary, read-only Codex session over
explicit event files. The raw event files are processed by the configured Codex
provider when this tool is invoked.

Generated Markdown memories remain local under `memories/resources/`.

Run one completed summary tick:

```bash
npm run pipeline:once
```

Run the persistent bucket scheduler:

```bash
npm run pipeline:run
```

The summarizer uses the recovered isolated Codex configuration and opens a
backoff circuit when the provider repeatedly fails.

## Original service inspector

The read-only inspector supports ping, status, settings, EventStream status, and
a combined snapshot:

```bash
reverse/original-ipc.mjs snapshot
```

Regenerate build-specific symbols, strings, entitlements, and IPC evidence:

```bash
reverse/extract-evidence.sh
```

The final controlled original comparison uses no personal content:

```bash
reverse/run-fixture-actions.sh
reverse/compare-event-streams.mjs \
  original-events.jsonl original-suppressed.jsonl \
  open-events.jsonl open-suppressed.jsonl
```

## Security

- Treat all recorded UI text as untrusted data. The summarizer explicitly
  rejects instructions found inside event content.
- Text and AX-tree fields are removed from MCP query results unless
  `includeText` is explicitly true.
- Local files can contain sensitive information. Protect the macOS account and
  use include-only policies for sensitive environments.
- Keep the MCP server bound locally unless you add authentication and deployment
  hardening. The event store is intentionally a local single-user design.

## Verification

Validated on August 14, 2026:

- Swift build and 12 Swift tests pass.
- TypeScript typecheck, 9 Node tests, MCP production build, and parity pass.
- `npm audit` reports zero known vulnerabilities.
- A real six-second recording produced 31 events across multiple desktop
  applications without screenshots.
- MCP discovery and status/recent/search tools passed through `mcp-use client`.
- The summarizer created a valid local Markdown memory through `codex exec`.
- Original-service IPC returned API version, status, settings, and the
  EventStream 1800-second maximum duration.
- Original-name MCP pause/resume/status/settings tools passed through a real MCP
  client, including launching the collector from stopped state.
- Segment rotation and pipeline bucket deduplication passed accelerated smoke
  tests.
- Browser URL and localized private-browsing suppression passed real smoke
  tests.
- Native wire compatibility passed by pointing the recovered original client at
  the open IPC server.
- The timeline View rendered in Widget-Declared CSP at desktop/mobile widths and
  completed app-private delete interaction.
- The ad-hoc signed `.app` passed strict `codesign` verification and launch
  smoke.
- A user-authorized original Fixture recording and the open recording passed
  the value-level event-stream comparator with zero differences.
- Original test history was cleared after the comparison.
